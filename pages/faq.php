<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3>1. What is this website about?</h3>
<p>This is my personal website where I share my thoughts, projects, and resources. 
It’s a space for me to express myself, document my work, and occasionally share useful information I’ve learned.</p>

<h3>2. Do you track visitors?</h3>
<p>No, I do not use third-party analytics or tracking scripts. My hosting provider automatically logs basic, 
non-personal information like country, device type, and IP address, but it does not identify individual visitors.</p>

<h3>3. Do you use cookies?</h3>
<p>By default, my website does not set cookies. If in the future I add features that require cookies 
(such as login or personalization), I will clearly inform visitors in the Cookie Policy.</p>

<h3>4. Can I use your content?</h3>
<p>You are welcome to share or reference my work for personal or educational purposes as long as you give proper credit. 
Commercial use without my permission is not allowed.</p>

<h3>5. How often do you update the website?</h3>
<p>I update this site whenever I have something new to share. There’s no fixed schedule, 
but I try to keep information as accurate and up-to-date as possible.</p>

<h3>6. Do you accept guest posts or collaborations?</h3>
<p>Currently, no. This is a personal website, and all content is created by me. 
If that changes, I’ll post an update about it.</p>

<h3>7. Are there external links on your site?</h3>
<p>Yes, I may link to my social media, references, or other websites I find useful. 
However, I am not responsible for their content or privacy practices.</p>

<h3>8. Do you block AI bots and invasive crawlers?</h3>
<p>Yes. I use technical measures to block known AI scrapers, invasive bots, and automated crawlers that 
don’t respect privacy. This helps protect my content and my visitors from unnecessary data harvesting.</p>

<h3>9. What is your Transparency Policy?</h3>
<p>Everything on this website is written by me unless otherwise stated. 
If I use sources or references, I clearly credit them. 
If I ever use affiliate links, sponsorships, or partnerships in the future, I will disclose them clearly.</p>

<h3>10. Can I sign up for a newsletter?</h3>
<p>Yes — if I offer a newsletter, signing up is completely voluntary. 
You only need to provide your email if you choose to subscribe, and you can unsubscribe anytime. 
I do not sell or share email addresses.</p>

<h3>11. How can I contact you?</h3>
<p>You can reach me through my social media links or any contact method provided on this website.</p>
