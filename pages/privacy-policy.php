<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website. Your privacy matters to me, and I am committed to protecting it. 
This policy explains what information is (and is not) collected when you visit, 
how it is handled, and the measures I take to safeguard it. 
I believe privacy should be the default, not an afterthought.</p>

<h2>Privacy By Default</h2>
<p>My website is designed with Privacy by Default and Privacy by Design principles. 
It is part of my responsibility to protect your privacy when you visit my website. 
I do my best to implement strong security measures so you can use it without worrying about privacy-related issues.</p>

<h2>No Third Party Analytics</h2>
<p>I do not use third-party analytics tools to track your behavior, the time you spend on my website, 
the pages you visit, or the links you click. I believe that your online privacy should remain private 
and should be protected with the utmost care, and I respect that.</p>

<h2>Hosting Analytics</h2>
<p>Even though I do not use third-party analytics or loggers, the hosting service I use 
logs some basic information by default, such as your country, the type of device used, 
and IP addresses. However, this information does not identify you personally. 
For example, if I visit my own website, it might log “Visitor from <b>Philippines</b> using this device,” 
but it will not log my name, exact location, or any other personal details. 
It will never record something like “Resteer John Lumbab from the Philippines visited your website 
with an IP address and using Android.” No names, exact addresses, phone numbers, 
or any information that can directly identify you are stored.</p>

<h2>I Do Not Collect Personal Information By Default</h2>
<p>You can visit my website for free without providing your name, phone number, email, or similar information. 
The only time I may receive your email is if you sign up for my <b>Newsletter</b>. 
This is completely voluntary and at your own discretion — I cannot force you to enter it.</p>

<h2>Protect Yourself</h2>
<p>There is no 100% security guarantee in the world. While I take steps to protect your privacy on my website, 
I also encourage you to take precautions when browsing online. Use a trusted browser, 
privacy-focused extensions, and secure email providers. 
In my own experience, I use Brave Browser, Privacy Badger as an extension, 
and email aliases when signing up for newsletters.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated from time to time. Please visit this page regularly to stay informed.</p>
