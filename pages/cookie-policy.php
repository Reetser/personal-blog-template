<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit. They are often used to remember your preferences, 
track your activity, or keep you logged in. I believe you deserve to know exactly how cookies are used here.</p>

<h2>No Cookies by Default</h2>
<p>By default, my website does not use cookies. I do not set any tracking cookies, advertising cookies, 
or analytics cookies when you visit. You can browse freely without worrying about invisible trackers following you around.</p>

<h2>Possible Cookies in the Future</h2>
<p>In the future, certain features (such as logins, preferences, or newsletter tools) might require cookies to function properly. 
If that happens, I will make it clear and update this policy so you know exactly what is being set and why.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
<p>Since I do not use third-party analytics or embedded ads, there are no external cookies loaded from outside services. 
However, if in the future I embed third-party content (such as videos, maps, or social media posts), 
those services might set their own cookies. I will let you know if this ever changes.</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>
<p>My website may contain links to external websites, such as my social media profiles, reference sources, or related content. 
These websites are not operated by me and may have their own cookie and privacy policies. 
Once you leave my website, you are subject to the terms and policies of the external site. 
I encourage you to review their privacy and cookie practices before interacting with them.</p>

<h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
<p>Even though my website doesn’t set cookies by default, you still have the power to control them in your browser. 
You can block, delete, or restrict cookies using your browser’s privacy settings. 
For example, I personally use Brave Browser with strict cookie blocking enabled.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>This Cookie Policy may be updated from time to time. Please check this page to stay informed about any changes.</p>
