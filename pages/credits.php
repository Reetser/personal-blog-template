  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    A website is one of the best spaces you can create in the digital world. 
    It’s flexible, customizable, and a great investment—whether you want to share your thoughts, 
    showcase your work, or simply be heard. Unlike social media platforms like 
    <i>Facebook</i> or <i>Instagram</i>, which are designed with fixed features, 
    building your own site gives you the freedom to shape it the way you want. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I’m not a professional web developer, nor do I claim to have advanced technical skills, 
    but with enough curiosity, resources, and creativity, I’ve managed to piece things together 
    to make this site come alive. This project is the result of combining different tools, 
    assets, and inspirations.  
    <br><br>
    I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the following people and projects—this website 
    wouldn’t be what it is today without their work.
  </p>

  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

  <p>
    Julio created the base design of this website and shared it through 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aj7HLsJenVg?feature=shared" target="_blank" class="preview-link">

  <p>
    The icons you see across this site—like the menu button, theme switcher, and social links—are 
    made possible by <b>Remixicon</b>, a fantastic free resource for high-quality icons.
  </p>

  <h3>

    The Age Verification process on this site can generate PDFs thanks to 
    <b>jsPDF</b>, an open-source library that makes working with PDFs in the browser possible.
  </p>

  <h3>

  <p>
    If you’ve signed anything during the Age Verification process, that’s thanks to 
    <b>Signature Pad</b>—a free and well-maintained library for capturing signatures digitally.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/videojs/video.js" class="preview-link" target="_blank">

    For videos on this site, I rely on <b>Video.js</b>, a flexible, open-source player 
    that makes embedding and customizing video playback seamless.

    </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    To showcase images with a clean, user-friendly lightbox, I use 
    <b>Lightbox2</b> by 
    <a href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/" class="preview-link">Lokesh Dhakar <i class="ri-links-line"></i></a>. 
    It’s simple, effective, and free to use.

    </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    I don’t have formal training in web development, but tools like <b>ChatGPT</b> 
    have been invaluable. From building a functional search box and dynamic meta tags 
    to experimenting with more ambitious ideas, ChatGPT has been my go-to for learning, 
    troubleshooting, and inspiration.
