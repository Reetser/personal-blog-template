## Introduction

A website is one of the best spaces you can create in the digital world.  
It’s flexible, customizable, and a great investment—whether you want to share your thoughts,  
showcase your work, or simply be heard. Unlike social media platforms like  
*Facebook* or *Instagram*, which are designed with fixed features,  
building your own site gives you the freedom to shape it the way you want.  

I’m not a professional web developer, nor do I claim to have advanced technical skills,  
but with enough curiosity, resources, and creativity, I’ve managed to piece things together  
to make this site come alive. This project is the result of combining different tools,  
assets, and inspirations.  

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the following people and projects—this website  
wouldn’t be what it is today without their work.

troubleshooting, and inspiration.
